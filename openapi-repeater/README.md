## OpenAPI to Repeater:

**OpenAPI to Repeater** is a simple Burp Suite extension that allows offensive security engineers to instantly load APIs into Repeater tabs. Utilizing the OpenAPI specification, it efficiently extracts and populates API HTTP requests into Repeater, allowing a smooth start to your API assessment.

Load the main.py in Burp Extensions as Python and browse to newly added tab (*OpenAPI to Repeater*), Enter the API host (*starts with HTTP://*), add cookies *(optional)*, upload the OpenAPI spec file as JSON format *(e.g, see openapi.json)*, click *Load To Repeater*.

**HAPPY HACKING!**
